# +1 Array
Given an array of integers of any length, return an array that has 1 added to the value represented by the array.

The array can't be empty and only non-negative, single digit integers are allowed. Return null for invalid inputs.

[2, 3, 9] equals 239, adding one would return the array [2, 4, 0]

# Input / Output

* [2, 3, 9] / [2, 4, 0]
* [4, 3, 2, 5] / [4, 3, 2, 6]
* [1, -9] / `null`
* [9] / [10]
