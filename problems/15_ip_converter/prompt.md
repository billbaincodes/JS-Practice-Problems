# Title

An IPv4 address is a 32-bit number that identifies a device on the internet.

While computers read and write IP addresses as a 32-bit number, we prefer to read them in dotted-decimal notation, which is basically the number split into 4 chunks of 8 bits, converted to decimal, and delimited by a dot.

```
//original IP address
192.168.1.1

//breaks down into 4 binary octets
11000000 . 10101000 . 00000001 . 00000001

//which are merged together (unsigned 32-bit binary)
11000000101010000000000100000001

//and finally converted to base 10
3232235777
```


## Input / Output
